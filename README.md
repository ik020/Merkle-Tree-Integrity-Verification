## Overview
This project implements a Merkle Tree-based cryptographic verification system for large-scale review datasets. It ensures data integrity, detects tampering, and provides efficient existence proofs.

## Features
- Build Merkle Trees from large JSON datasets
- Generate proof paths for individual reviews
- Verify integrity and detect tampering
- Performance metrics and benchmarking

## Folder Structure
- `include/` - Header files for modules
- `src/` - Source code implementations
- `data/` - Sample datasets
- `docs/` - Figures, report, and documentation
- `tests/` - Unit tests and performance benchmarks
- `scripts/` - Preprocessing and utility scripts

## Installation
Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ik020/Merkle-Tree-Integrity-Verification.git
